	JSON files need to follow the example format:
	<br />
	[<br />
	"W002237-S031430",<br />
	"W002537-N031130"<br />
	]<br />
	
	where each row represents a set of coordinate, and each coordinates has the format of "{EASTWEST COORDS}-{NORTHSOUTH COORDS}".<br />
	Single digits are padded with 0, for example a in-game coordinates of W 0°22'33" S 3°14'30" will become "W002237-S031430"<br />
	It also needs to be a .json file.
